Asteroids Game

A simple Asteroids-style game developed using the SFML library in C++. This project is designed to help enhance programming skills and understand game development fundamentals.

Project Description

The Asteroids Game replicates the classic arcade game where the player controls a spaceship navigating through space, avoiding and destroying asteroids. The game includes features such as:

	•	Player Control: Move the spaceship using keyboard inputs.
	•	Asteroid Generation: Randomly spawn asteroids of varying sizes and speeds.
	•	Collision Detection: Detect and handle collisions between the spaceship and asteroids.
	•	Scoring System: Keep track of the player’s score based on destroyed asteroids.
	•	Game Over State: End the game when the spaceship collides with an asteroid.

What I Learned

	•	C++ Programming: Improved my proficiency in C++ through object-oriented programming concepts and efficient coding practices.
	•	SFML Library: Gained experience using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for handling graphics, window management, and user input.
	•	Game Development Fundamentals: Learned the basics of game loops, event handling, and real-time rendering.
	•	Collision Detection: Implemented collision detection algorithms to manage interactions between game objects.
	•	Object-Oriented Design: Designed and organized code using classes and objects to represent game entities like the spaceship and asteroids.
	•	Debugging and Problem-Solving: Enhanced my ability to debug code and solve logical problems that arise during development.
	•	Project Organization: Learned to structure a project by separating different functionalities into distinct classes and files for better maintainability.
