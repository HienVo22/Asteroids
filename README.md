Asteroids

A very fun and simple Asteroids-style game developed using C++ and the SFML library. I got the insparation for creating this side project from recently playing the arcade version of this game at an arcade in Atlanta. (it was at Joystick Gamebar highly recommended!)

Project Description

The Asteroids Game replicates the classic arcade game where the player controls a spaceship navigating through space, avoiding and destroying asteroids. The game includes features such as:

	•	Player Control: Move the spaceship using keyboard inputs (e.g., arrow keys for rotation and thrust).
	•	Bullet Mechanics: Shoot bullets to destroy asteroids. Bullets are fired in the direction the spaceship is facing.
	•	Asteroid Implementation: Randomly spawn asteroids of different sizes and speeds, moving in different directions.
	•	Physics Implementation:
	•		Movement Physics: Implemented realistic movement for the spaceship and asteroids.
	•		Collision Physics: Handled collisions between the spaceship, bullets, and asteroids with appropriate responses (asteroids breaking into smaller pieces upon being hit).
	•	Collision Implementation: Detect and handle collisions between the spaceship and asteroids, as well as bullets and asteroids.
	•	Scoring System: Keep track of the player’s score based on destroyed asteroids.
	•	Game Over: End the game when the spaceship collides with an asteroid and display the highest score for that round.

What I Learned


	•	C++ Fundamentals: Improved my proficiency in C++ through object-oriented programming concepts.
	•	SFML Library: Gained experience using the SFML for handling graphics, window management, and user input.
	•	Game Development: Learned the basics of game loops, event handling, and real-time rendering.
	•	Object-Oriented Design: Designed and organized code using classes and objects to represent game entities like the spaceship, asteroids, and bullets.
	•	Debugging and Problem-Solving: Enhanced my ability to debug code and solve logical problems that arise during development.
